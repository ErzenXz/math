         <p>
            A matrix solver is a tool that helps solve mathematical problems involving matrices. It
            provides functionalities to perform operations such as addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and inversion of matrices. Additionally, it can calculate determinants
            and more.

         <p>
            A system of linear equations solver is a tool that solves a set of linear equations
            simultaneously. It takes the coefficients of the variables and the constant terms as
            input and calculates the values of the variables that satisfy all the equations. This is
            useful in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.
